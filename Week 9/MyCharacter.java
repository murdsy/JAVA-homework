/*
 * Computer games often contain different characters or creatures. For example, you
might design a game in which alien beings possess specific characteristics such as
color, number of eyes, or number of lives. Design a character for a game, creating a
class to hold at least three attributes for the character. Include methods to get and
set each of the character’s attributes. Save the file as MyCharacter.java. Then write
an application in which you create at least two characters. In turn, pass each
character to a display method that displays the character’s attributes. Save the
application as TwoCharacters.java.
