/*Create an educational program for children that 
distinguishes between vowels and consonants as the
 user clicks buttons. Create 26 JButtons, each labeled 
 with a different letter of the alphabet. Create a 
 JFrame to hold three JPanels in a twoby-two grid. Randomly 
 select eight of the 26 JButtons and place four in each of 
 the first two JPanels. Add a JLabel to the third JPanel. 
 When the user clicks a JButton, the text of the JLabel 
 identifies the buttonâ€™s letter as a vowel or consonant, 
 and then a new randomly selected letter replaces the 
 letter on the JButton. Save the file as JVowelConsonant.java. */
