 /* Desc:
 a. Create an application named Percentages whose main() method holds two
double variables. Assign values to the variables. Pass both variables to a method
named computePercent() that displays the two values and the value of the first
number as a percentage of the second one. For example, if the numbers are 2.0
and 5.0, the method should display a statement similar to “2.0 is 40 percent of 5.0.”
Then call the method a second time, passing the values in reverse order. Save the
application as Percentages.java.

b. Modify the Percentages class to accept the values of the two doubles from a user
at the keyboard. Save the file as Percentages2.java.
